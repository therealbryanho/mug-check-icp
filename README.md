#### Project Description

Mug Check ICP is a Web3 sustainability-focused DApp that encourages eco-friendly habits by rewarding users for using reusable mugs. Users log in with their Plug Wallet and upload an image of their reusable mug with coffee. Using AI, the app verifies the mug's reusability. Verified submissions earn reward tokens that can be redeemed for merchant discounts. Merchants can purchase tokens to gain ad space within the platform, fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem that promotes environmental responsibility.

#### The Problem it solves

Single-use coffee cups, often made from paper or plastic, contribute significantly to global waste and environmental degradation. Despite efforts to recycle, most single-use cups end up in landfills due to contamination or lack of recycling infrastructure. Mug Check ICP incentivizes individuals to adopt sustainable habits by providing tangible rewards for using reusable mugs, thereby reducing waste. At the same time, it provides merchants with a new way to promote their eco-friendly initiatives, creating a win-win for both users and businesses.
